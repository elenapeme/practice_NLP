that have been reviewed and analyzed to death  but the reason why it has garnered so much critical attention is that it truly one of the most original and groundbreaking albums in rock history  brian wilson had spent the previous few years writing and producing magnificent singles  but had yet made a truly great album  spurred on by the beatles  rubber soul and his idol  phil spector  mr  wilson set about to make an album that raised the bar on what could be achieved on a pop album  he succeeded on every level  pet sounds is one of the most literate  intricate and lavishly produced albums ever released  the other band members were limited to just providing vocals on the album as mr  wilson employed studio musicians to provide the music  despite this fact  the band never sounded better as they provide the luscious harmonies that make the songs practically float out of your speakers  the songs were no longer about surfing and cars  but about more mature relationships and growing up   quot wouldn t be nice quot  is a beautiful song about wanting to get married that hit number 8 on the charts   quot you still believe in me quot  is an airy number about a woman standing by her man   quot don t talk  put your head on my shoulder  quot  is another gorgeous melody and  quot sloop john b quot  is a traditional song that was the album s biggest hit peaking at number 2   quot i just was not made for these times quot  is another brilliant introspective number from brian wilson and  quot caroline no quot  is a beautiful ballad that closes the original album out and was actually released as solo recording by mr  wilson   quot god only knows quot  is perhaps the most heartbreakingly beautiful song the band has ever recorded and is the essence of the album  carl wilson gives his hands down best lead vocal and the song is a virtual symphony  pet sounds was not a big hit in the us  peaking at number 10  as americans wanted songs about sun and fun in the sun  but in england  the album was a huge success peaking at number 2 and blew the minds of the british musicians  one in particular  paul mccartney called it the greatest album ever made and it was the beatles  inspiration for recording sgt  pepper s  brian wilson tried to top pet sounds with smile  but that album was never to be  pet sounds stands as the beach boys greatest album and one the best of all time \n","-----------\n","Review\n","this is one of the first madonna albums i listened to in my whole life  im 16  my aunt a really big madonna fan leant me this album to listen to because she was always telling me odd things about madonna and the 80s and i began to asked questions related to madonna so she thought i would like listening to madonna well the truth is i loved the album when she leant it to me  my favorites then were drowned world  frozen and ray of light and i listened to the whole album but those were still the best later on in my school year is was planning to buy the album however it ended up my friend had it and wanted to trade it for my janet jackson velvet rope  well obviously we made the trade because i do not like janet jackson that much and still do not to this day because madonna is still the master of music i began to listen to that album every day and loved it  and madonna related this to her own personal life now you wonder why i gave it 4 stars instead of five  well the truth is i like madonna in all but there is fewer upbeat songs than quiet sort of spiritual songs  do not get me wrong this album is a work of art and still known as her best album to date but lets just say if you lidten to it often you will easily become bored with it like myself all in all a worthy purchase and recomended definatly to fans of  quot like a prayer  quot  good work madonna  erotica almost broke you  in my eyes it made you \n","-----------\n","Review\n","it is amazing how much emotion gary numan was able to evoke with an album so dominated by electronic instruments  numan produced a number of great albums in his heyday  i m not a big fan of his recent  dark material   but the pleasure principle  with its magritte take off cover  has best withstood the test of time for me  replicas comes close  but i think this is gary at his best cars became a hit here and in the uk  but the rest of the cuts are every bit as strong  and there is a sensitivity on display behind the andriod cool that makes this music far more than the sum of its parts  couple that with an excellent rhythm section  great keyboard textures  and first rate arrangements  and you have an album that never seems to wear out its welcome gary numan s voice can tend to become grating on some of his albums  but not this one \n","-----------\n","Review\n","the first thing you notice when you spin  or in my case ipod snakes   arrows  the new outing by rush  is that the heavy musical voice of rush is back  very ambitious  very sonically sophisticated  very good  i have been a fan for many  many  many years  since i was like 10 years old  and that is 28 years  i own everything they have ever done  you could say  yes  that i am a rush fan  now  the possible bad news  this is not moving pictures  this is not hemispheres or signals or permanent waves or power windows  the old rush is long gone and it is very hard to look back without a pang of longing  of sadness  so it goes  the ony bad thing i will say about sankes   arrows is that unlike moving pictures or hemispheres or signals or so many of their older albums  there are very few hooks here to distinguish many of the later songs from one another  that is distracting and makes it so much harder to remember the songs and their titles  let us break down the album far cry   lyrically  i like it very much  driving  pounding rush straigh out of the gate  i immediately like the feel that this song gives off  sounds like old rush in a way  one day i feel i am on top of the world  the next it is falling in on me  great opening song armor and sword   does this song purposely drag  it does  musically sound  i do not really dig the lyrics or the way geddy delivers them  sounds strained  not going to be a favorite workin  them angels   sounds like something off of test for echo  forceful and yet a little light  is that possible  yeah  i like the chorus and the sound is strangely experimental in places like alex is rocking the mandolin or something in the background  sounds very nearly irish and i like that  wrokin  them angels   overtime the larger bowl   acoustic and moody  this reminds me of resist in its simplicity and yet it builds in complexity  some are blessed and some are cursed  the golden one or scarred from birth  dark  definitely  i like it spindrift   yeah  you can feel the press of this song  like a funeral dirge or a piece of dramatic prose  driven  that is what i call it  driven  what am i supposed to say  where are the words to answer you when you talk that way  oh yeah the main monkey business   instrumental  layered  complex  very structurally sound  not yyz  not la villa strangiato  elegant  cryptic  classic  i am going to say no  just because i do not crave to hear it again and again  a great piece of work  but  like i said  not yyz  i can hum that from memory  i cannot with this the way the wind blows   i like the drum intro in the bluesy wail of alex s guitar  nice  very nice  this some comes at you and that is unexpected this deep into a newer rush album  the sound here is elegant  pray  and pass the ammunition  political commentary on the dark way of the world hope   two instrumentals on the same album  wow  do i hear another bit of irish influence here  i think i do and i like it alot  acoustic and ambitious  more of a blurb than the typical rush instrumental  this sounds like a straight ahead nod to alex playing something he wanted us to hear and it works very well faithless   this sounds like something off of geddy s solo album  my favorite headache  not going to be a memorable song  it is a tad to airy and hookless  middle of the road bravest face   here the songs really start to blend  musically  rush experiments here with acoustic sounds and that keeps us interested  but the lyrics are not very arresting and geddy s delivery has become strained  spots of brilliance as usual  but goes over too smooth for me  maybe another dozen listens would make me like this song more  maybe good news first   the signature rush sound  this song sounds like they could play it in their sleep without a mistake  do not like the way geddy is trying to sing here  does not sound good  hmmmmmmmm malignant narcissism   instrumental  3  what the hell is going on here  have we lost our minds  we have  but in a good way  there is nothing better than listening to alex  geddy   neil in full tilt jam mode  this song shows us some chops and we appreciate that  closer to yyz than any of the other instrumentals with its steady pound and bass  drum   guitar blurbs  excellent we hold on   cool  kinda trippy sound  nice chorus  hook  maybe just a little one  but it is enough to make this song stand out against the flow of snakes   arrows  makes me want to hear it again overall  what you can take from snakes   arrows is that rush actually had fun making this album together and did in fact record many parts in the studio as a unit  where in the past they had done most of the recording individually  you can feel that vibe on the album that there was a definite sense of ease to the approach in which these songs were devised and that is a good thing  there is a freer  lest structured approach that adds some freshness to the rush way of doing things  hearing three instrumentals on one single rush abum alone tells us that the trio were jamming together and jamming well  some songs blend and that is something to expect as the fat and flab of age and familiarity have come to rest upon rush  but the music is clever and inspired and perfect as usual  not moving pictures  but we understand that  still a very powerful outing and well worth the coin dig it \n","-----------\n","Review\n","amy macdonald s us debut albumthis is the lifeis a strong start for a young singer songwriter  despite the shortcomings  every time i listened to it i liked it more  amy steadily played uk venues for several years before topping the uk charts just last year  she is now being given her us debut with a slightly modified album that includes the extra track  the road to home  and the hidden track  caledonia  the steady playing of all the musicians comes through on the recording  and the songs are driven with insistent guitars and strong yet simple vocals my least favorite tracks the youth of today  was supposedly written when she was fifteen  and i personally would have replaced it with another  it seems to have the unnecessary defiance of a childishavril lavigne  it is difficult to know if her prosaic lecturing of the  older generation  is in earnest or meant to be a criticism of youth  the song is still catchy  and could easily become a hit in the us  yet in  footballers wives  she seems to try to have it both ways  criticizing the reality tv culture of today and glorifying the  good old days  of the golden era  neither song is terrible  but listening too closely makes it harder to enjoy them  let s start a band  is another one of my least favorite songs  the song starts off ok but then abruptly breaks into a repetition of the track s title  suffice it to say  it is no surprise that amy macdonald has debuted as a solo artist  the whole  band  thing is a lot harder to sustain than this song would imply the good this is the life  is a nice title track that is both catchy and optimistic  it is a nice tempo to follow the very fast  mr  rock   roll   a great song that leads off the album and is certain to be a strong single for her   run  is also a great song  and i can definitely see this track being used in movies and tv  barrowland ballroom   named for the legendary glasgow scotland venue  is a great track that highlights the hopes and dreams of all young performers to make it to the big stage  this might be the sleeper single on this record  poison prince  has a tone akin tothe doorsbut a few trite lyrics that do not match  it has grown on me though  similarly   l a   was one of the songs that also grew on me  a wish for something more  is a very good song  while it is a personal favorite  it may be too pensive for the middle of the album  i cannot help but wonder if they should have started with the slower material and built up to the faster ballads the highlight tracks on the album for me are  the road home   which is performed sweetly and simply  and the hidden track  caledonia   both songs are very well done conclusionthis album has an outside chance for mainstream radio airplay  it will definitely get its fair share of airtime on the ever growing network of independent and college radio stations in the us  while i would normally draw comparisons to other music  i think amy macdonald really has a unique sound  listen to the samples and watch the videos  if you like folk music from off the beaten path  you may have found a new favorite here enjoy \n","-----------\n","Review\n","1 1 intro   0 41 4 5 funny but korny at the same time2 in my hood   3 51 5 5 good beat3

before they run out \n","-----------\n","Review\n","just about everything bad and good has been said about this album  50 cent s major debut was a decent album in 2003 that was highly blown out of proportion on how good it was  sort of like nelly s  country grammar   but there are some good parts to it and some bad parts to it  50 cent s gangsta attitude would be shown all over the album  mostly about guns  sex  drugs  and money  the 2003 rap song of the year  in da club  was overrated to me  but it was a decent track at best  the second single  21   s  i hated because of it is pop style and lack luster beat that it carries  the third single  many men  was one of my favorite tracks that was dedicated to more violence  the fourth single  p i m p   was a medicore song about pimping on the origonal version  although the remix that features snoop dogg and g unit that does not appear on here is better  the rest of the tracks range from decent to good that will make your head nod  some i enjoyed and some that i hated   patiently waiting  featuring eminem is possibly one of the best songs on the album  as both of them have above average verses  the track  if i can t  has a fast paced piano beat  that makes the song gangsta and listenable   what up gangsta  will have little kids thinking they are hardcore repeating that song  because of it is catchy hook  50 cent s slurred vocals could get a liitle annoying at some parts of the cd  because he was shot in the jaw when he took those nine bullets production is done by dr  dre  eminem  and more it sold about 9 million copies  so i am pretty sure that most rap and alternative listener has at least taken a listen lyrics  c production  bguest appearances  b musical vibes  c overall  c favorite tracks  patiently waiting  many men  if i can t  life s on the line  wanksta\n","-----------\n","Review\n","mark knopfler and emmylou harris are outstanding  these are great songs  you cannot get the melodies
